Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not

Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol

Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema

If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not

This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol

Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema

This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry

Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry

Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not

Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol

Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema

If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not

This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol

Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema

This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry

Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry

Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not

Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol

Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema

If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not

This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol

Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema

This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry

Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry

Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not

Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol

Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema

If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not

This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol

Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema

This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry

Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry

Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not

Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol

Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema

If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not

This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD 
This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol

This movie has the same problems as part one  The editing in this is terrible  Scenes don t connect  they start an assignment or story branch  then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests  No idea is complete  nothing gets resolved  and the dialogue is horrendous These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow  If you haven t read the books you won t understand anything that s happening here  What we have here is a movie that is really pretty  It maxes out in the visuals category  The sound was hit or miss  but the plot  pacing and characters were all bad Not a masterpiece  Sorry 
Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey  and I was completely blown away  From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored  which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film I don t want to write too much here  I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately  It doesn t release worldwide until March 1st  so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible  Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar s for sound editing  picture  etc   and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically  Like I stated in the beginning  see this film 
The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no one seems to really acknowledge    the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden  Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling  Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone  like George Clooney Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours  All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don t go to movies to be entertained  Between the acting of Zendaya  Dave Bautista  Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting  assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting It s time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not 
Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  Dune  Part 2  is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind  As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise  it s been a long time since iv e encountered this level of world building and epicness  The plot and story development are carried out in an awe inspiring manner throughout the movie  progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time  and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does  The film received praise from many great filmmakers  the most notable being Christopher Nolan  The Dark Knight Trilogy  Oppenheimer   who very accurately compared Villeneuve s achievement in this film to the  Empire Strikes Back  of the modern era Would highly recommend to re watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better  though it s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self contained  More specifically  one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part  Of course  for those who really want to enjoy the story  there s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one  However  even those who watched it a few years ago and don t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt  2 and will understand all the important details even the smaller ones  Non ideally  even someone who hasn t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one  as it is very self contained despite relying heavily on the first movie an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers Timoth e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance  to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play  Zendaya also gives a very good performance  with significantly more screen time than in the first movie  Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain  Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year  and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie  In addition to them  the film is filled with top tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly Hans Zimmer s score is masterful just as you d expect  and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt  1  Technical aspects such as VFX  Production Design  Sound  Editing  etc  Are all top notch and awards worthy  The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine  Denis direction is impeccable  and the story is absolutely fascinating  continuing to develop characters from Pt  1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters In my personal opinion  the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect  While the first part was excellent  it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel  In  Part 2   the story reaches its climax  with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades  befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago I believe  and surely hope  this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season  Below the line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now  but I hope it will get some love in above the line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture  perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy Sci Fi genre in recent years at the Academy  As a big fan of the genre  unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period  maybe it s time for a movie like this to triumph once again While the movie serves as a great wrap up to the story introduced in Pt  1  in my opinion it could serve as an even better set up to a possible masterpiece in  Dune  Messiah   which I really hope will get green lit soon Don t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX  since I believe it s an historic piece of epic Fantasy Sci Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre Extremely recommended 
If you liked or loved the first one  the same will apply for this one  Personally  I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well  So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now  This is everything I love about going to the movies  Also  Hans Zimmer For book readers  I d say this one takes more liberties than the first  but they were changes I liked  some for the better even  For the most part  it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered  The biggest change being no time jump  Therefore  a certain character doesn t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book  Though  they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally I know it s early in the year  but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie  Best Picture  Best Director  Best Adapted Screenplay  Best Editing  Best Cinematography  Best Score  Best Sound  Best Visual Effects  Best Costume  Best Production Design  Best Makeup  and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress  I guess that s pretty much every category now that I ve typed it out lol 
Dune Part 2 is an epic movie  slickly made  and visually stunning But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book  especially the water of life scene and the final battle The movie had almost a 3 hour run time  but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance It is a beautiful movie  but it feels like it has no soul  The emotional connection between Paul and Chani  so vital to the story  is completely lacking and unbelievable  The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things  but she has basically 2 facial expressions here  and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul  I found her to be the worst part of this movie The final fight scene is short  choppy  and a mess  It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish  The ending was super abrupt  and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel I want to reiterate that this isn t a bad movie  Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing  but he can t give life to individual characters It is like he can t see the trees for the forest 
This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice  just by talking about it  It is the kind of experience you had once   but you never thought you would get again   until this movie proves you WRONG  This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible  already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME  Everything in this movie was TOP notch  Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci Fi movies  but just filmmaking in general  This was a demonstration of power  in what you can achieve with filmmaking I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find  This will be an experience that will stick with you forever I thought the real Blockbuster was dead   but I was wrong  This is the cinematic experience i craved Now I am gonna watch this movie again  and maybe again  Then I am gonna read the books 
Like the first part  the second part is visually stunning  though having read the book twice  I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties  De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical mythical core of the story  This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied  In De Villeneuve s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about  both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother  For example  in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing Having left this essence out of the movies  they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience  A kind of secular  profane Dune  Still nice  but also a bit disappointing 
This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie  Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame  Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15 000 years of civilization  Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling  Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch  The pacing is irregular  at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed  Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material  you don t get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made  Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films  is probably not doing the story justice  should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work  therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely 
A monumental piece of cinema Paced to perfection  uniquely beautiful  thought provoking  beyond thrilling  with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding  Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring  An entire production on their A Game   it s an incredible technical achievement  Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special  Denis Villeneuve s love for  Dune  shines through every stunning frame  Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful  but here he improves on it in every way  It just doesn t get better than this 
This was a perfect sequel to Denis  part one  It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having  This film will go down as one of the best in sci fi fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted  Not in the longest time has a franchise  and a singular movie  captivated me in such a way  This story  these characters  this planet  Dune  lives rent free in my mind  You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX  as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene  This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling  10 10 
I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible  See for yourself in IMAX  The characters  acting  screenplay  world building  storytelling  score  actions sequences  cinematography  and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece  Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking  The casting continuation was perfect all the way through  with great new add ons  Timothee Chalamet is believable  raw and real as Paul Atriedes  He was flawless as the lead  Zendaya  Rebecca Ferguson  Javier Bardem  and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual  Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil  Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd Rautha  and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts Overall  Dune  Part Two is an inspiring  visually stunning sci fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth  adventure  and destiny on a galactic scale  It s a fantastic piece of filmmaking  rarely seen in modern day cinema 
We have waited many  many years for a movie of this caliber  I m 59 years old  a female  grandmother and retired   this was THE  BEST  MOVIE I have ever seen  I don t tend to like si fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor   The length of this movie wasn t even noticed by us  it wasn t long enough to be honest  We wanted MORE  It ended and we weren t done yet  We know how long it takes for sequels to come along   so who knows if I ll still be on the planet to see it  I hope I am  And I hope they can do it justice  The last time I remember a movie being THIS good  I was in high school in the 80 s  DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE  CRAZY GOOD
